Instructions
How to make caramel for flan
Mix sugar and water and cook in a heavy saucepan over low heat until a thick, dark caramel syrup forms. Make sure it does not burn!
Pour carefully into 10" [25 cm] baking pan and spread all over. Cool down until the caramel hardens.
For the flan
Heat oven to 300 ºF [150ºC].
Mix together egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk. Stir in vanilla. Sieve to get rid of undissolved egg parts. Pour carefully into baking pan, trying not to disturb the caramel layer.
Bake in hot water bath (bain Marie) in the oven for one hour or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool down to room temperature. Loosen edges of flan, place a serving plate on top of the mold (one which will retain the syrup) and invert.
Chill before serving.
